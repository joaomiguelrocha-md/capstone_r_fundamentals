## Modelos

-   If a systematic relationship exists between two variables it will appear as a pattern in the data. If you spot a pattern, ask yourself:

    -   Could this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

    -   How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?

    -   How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?

    -   What other variables might affect the relationship?

    -   Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

```{r}
gdh_pca <-  gdh_base_clean |> 
  filter(
    idade != -1,
    cod_dist_chr != "99",
    cod_conc_chr != "99"
  ) |> 
  select(
    sexo,
    idade,
    dias_int, 
    adm_tip,
    tipo_port_apr31, 
    dsp, 
    dt_mun,
  )


```
