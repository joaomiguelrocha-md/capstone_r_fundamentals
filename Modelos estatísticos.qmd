## Modelos

-   If a systematic relationship exists between two variables it will appear as a pattern in the data. If you spot a pattern, ask yourself:

    -   Could this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

    -   How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?

    -   How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?

    -   What other variables might affect the relationship?

    -   Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?
